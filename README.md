# Marimo notebook to show off AoC results

The idea is to practice Marimo and to get good platform to show off a bit. I liked @norvig's approach to publish (pytudes)[https://github.com/norvig/pytudes/blob/main/ipynb/Advent-2020.ipynb]. But I don't like jupyter too much! I mean it's language-agnostic, but pretty much all other design choices made my sad by some reason.

## TODO

- [ ] Make at least one day solution as I see it in my ideal world:
  - [ ] Introductory text from AoC site
  - [ ] Literate-programming style sources of the solution
  - [ ] Dynamic calculations for input examples
  - [ ] Some info for long-running calculations?
  - [ ] Puzzle-specific graphics generated in realtime?
- [ ] Git action to publish to github pages
- [ ] Implement some pytests just for sake of getting the knack of it with marimo
- [ ] Implement safe-enough user input for puzzles
